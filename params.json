{"name":"Subwayinterface","tagline":"Subway Restaurant Automation","body":"### Overview:\r\nThis was a project for a Human Computer Interface class. The system envisioned in the project is a touch interface in a kiosk to place orders for a subway sandwich. On placing the order, the idea is that the kiosk would print a ticket with an order number and estimated wait time so you don't have to wait in line during rush hours. (javascript based)\r\n\r\n### User characteristics:\r\nThe main motivation of the project is to minimize the whole time spent on getting a subway sandwich\r\nfrom the Subway on campus during rush hours. So, primarily, the users would be students and faculty. Some\r\ncharacteristics:\r\n- Many students don’t have much time for lunch in-between classes, so they want to avoid long lines.\r\n- Most of the users own touch screen phones; it would be easy for them to use the interface.\r\n- Many users cut down on their customization of the sandwich when the line is super long because of\r\nthe guilt feeling that they are holding up the line.\r\n\r\n### Task analysis:\r\n- Users stand in line, and wait for their turn.\r\n- They first select either sandwich or pizza.\r\n- As they go down the line, they tell the employees how they want it and get it customized.\r\n- At the end of the line they reach the cashier and pay for the food and get it.\r\n\r\nThis whole process takes place in the restaurant. During rush hours, the user interacts with about 3-5\r\nemployees to place his/her order.\r\n\r\n###Existing system:\r\nCurrently, the system is manual. The customers stand in line and interact with employees to get what\r\nthey want.\r\nPositive thing about this is that the customers talk to a human and they can give them very specific\r\ninstructions and actually see the employee make the sandwich. It’s the next best thing than you making\r\nthe sandwich yourself.\r\nNegatives:\r\n- During rush hours, the employees don’t have the time to be nice and sometimes they don’t\r\neven look at you.\r\n- Since the customers are in line till the sandwich is made and paid for at the cashier, this adds to the time taken, and leads to a long slow-moving line.\r\n\r\n### Larger social and technical system:\r\nThe kiosk will not replace but augment the existing system at the restaurant. It will give the\r\ncustomers another way to order. The design will intersect with the existing system in place in terms of\r\nmenu items and prices. The interface will also follow the steps currently used by the employees while\r\ntaking orders; first bread, then cheese, meat, toasted/untoasted, toppings, condiments/sauce. This is\r\nbecause everyone is familiar to the steps and it would be much easier to learn the new interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usability criteria/principles:\r\n- Easy to learn/intuitive: Should be easy for first-time users to place an order using the interface.\r\n- Efficient: Should allow the user to place an order as fast as possible.\r\n- Memorable: Should be easy to recollect the steps/process for users using it after a long gap.\r\n- Errors: The chances of users making errors should be minimal.\r\n- Satisfaction: User should be satisfied after using the interface.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@RaviChimmalgi\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
