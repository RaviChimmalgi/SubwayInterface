# SubwayInterface
This was a project for a Human Computer Interface class. The system envisioned in the project is a touch interface in a kiosk to place orders for a subway sandwich. On placing the order, the idea is that the kiosk would print a ticket with an order number and estimated wait time so you don't have to wait in line during rush hours. (javascript based)
