# SubwayInterface

This was a project for a Human Computer Interface class. The system envisioned in the project is a touch interface in a kiosk to place orders for a subway sandwich. On placing the order, the idea is that the kiosk would print a ticket with an order number and estimated wait time so you don't have to wait in line during rush hours. (javascript based)

## Features:

- Using the app follows the process of ordering a subway sandwich in person
- Selected options are visible and can be deleted

## Running the app:
- App can be accessed easily accessed [here](http://ravichimmalgi.github.io/SubwayInterface/interface.html)
- Download project and open interface.html in a browser.

## Issues:
This is a front-end interface only. There is no back-end functionality.

## Technology
Html, Javascript
