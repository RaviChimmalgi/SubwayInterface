<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview:</h3>

<p>This was a project for a Human Computer Interface class. The system envisioned in the project is a touch interface in a kiosk which will allow users to make a subway sandwich and place an order. On placing the order, it prints a ticket with order number and estimated wait time.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-characteristics" class="anchor" href="#user-characteristics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User characteristics:</h3>

<p>The main motivation of the project is to minimize the whole time spent on getting a subway sandwich
from the Subway on campus during rush hours. So, primarily, the users would be students. Some
characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many students don’t have much time for lunch in-between classes, so they want to avoid long lines.</li>
<li>Most of the users own touch screen phones; it would be easy for them to use the interface.</li>
<li>Many users cut down on their customization of the sandwich when the line is super long because of
the guilt feeling that they are holding up the line.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="task-analysis" class="anchor" href="#task-analysis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task analysis:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Users stand in line, and wait for their turn.</li>
<li>They first select either sandwich or pizza.</li>
<li>As they go down the line, they tell the employees how they want it and get it customized.</li>
<li>At the end of the line they reach the cashier and pay for the food and get it.</li>
</ul><p>This whole process takes place in the restaurant. During rush hours, the user interacts with about 3-5
employees to place his/her order.</p>

<h3>
<a name="existing-system" class="anchor" href="#existing-system"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Existing system:</h3>

<p>Currently, the system is manual. The customers stand in line and interact with employees to get what
they want.
Positive thing about this is that the customers talk to a human and they can give them very specific
instructions and actually see the employee make the sandwich. It’s the next best thing than you making
the sandwich yourself.
Negatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>During rush hours, the employees don’t have the time to be nice and sometimes they don’t
even look at you.</li>
<li>In rush hours, employees are stretched to their limit and end up not being as friendly as you
expect them.</li>
<li>Since the customers are in line till the sandwich is made, this adds to the time taken, and leads
to long slow moving line.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="larger-social-and-technical-system" class="anchor" href="#larger-social-and-technical-system"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Larger social and technical system:</h3>

<p>The kiosk will not replace but augment the existing system in place at the restaurant. It will give the
customers another way to order. The design will intersect with the existing system in place in terms of
menu items and prices. The interface will also follow the steps currently used by the employees while
taking orders; first bread, then cheese, meat, toasted/untoasted, toppings, condiments/sauce. It is
because everyone if familiar to the steps and it would be much easier to learn the new interface.</p>

<a name="usability-criteriaprinciples" class="anchor" href="#usability-criteriaprinciples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usability criteria/principles:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Easy to learn/intuitive: Should be easy for first-time users to place an order using the interface.</li>
<li>Efficient: Should allow the user to place an order as fast as possible.</li>
<li>Memorable: Should be easy to recollect the steps/process for users using it after a long gap.</li>
<li>Errors: The chances of users making errors should be minimal.</li>
<li>Satisfaction: User should be satisfied after using the interface.</li>
